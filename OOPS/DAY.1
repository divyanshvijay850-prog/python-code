# why we use object oriented programming
# the problem whith procedural programming that we cant't handle each of variables or entities which are initialaised into the program
#ex- you have to change the name of any student then you have to remember the student name variable. which would be difficult to remember that so that's
# why we use the OOPS.

# OOPS
# we make blueprint of any object or entity which is  known as class
# the real world entity  which we use into that class
# that is object.
